# Excel Virtually Global 2020 Code

This repo contains the sample code from the "Integrating Python and Excel" talk given at the
*Excel Virtually Global 2020* conference.

**Note:** Some code will require PyXLL to be installed. PyXLL is an Excel add-in that
embeds Python into Excel for writing Python based Excel add-ins. It can be
downloaded for free from [https://www.pyxll.com]() for a 30 day trial and it
requires a license after that period. Licenses can be bought online, also from
[https://www.pyxll.com]().

To use the PyXLL samples you will need to update your pyxll.cfg file as per the sample
pyxll.cfg file included in this repo.

Example workbooks are also provided in some folders within the demos folder. These workbooks
require PyXLL to be installed and configured.

See the files in the individual demos for more detailed descriptions and instructions.
